Contrary to what this blog says, I have things other than pasta on my mind. Some of these things will go into this blog. These thoughts are the thoughts of a privileged white male, who was raised and socialized in southern Germany, but lives in Berlin since 2011. 

I learned my basic scientific education at Technische Universit√§t Berlin (aerospace engineering), but realized early on that I also need to view my engineering activities in a sociocultural context. My time at HPI School of Design Thinking further sharpened my personal perspective on the (mostly) wonderful world we are living in. And as long as I can read the Roger Willemsen's books, I am grateful for each day on Earth.
