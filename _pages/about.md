![Pasta](../images/pasta.jpg)

You may wonder why you see a picture of my homemade pasta here. While I spend a lot of my time with "science", my first priority is living a good life. I am far away from completely understanding what a good life is, but I am pretty sure that for me good food is a crucial part of it. 
This blog aims to be a valve for my thoughts that neither go in academic papers nor in my recipe notebook. These thoughts are the thoughts of a person, who was raised and socialized in southern Germany but lives in Berlin since 2011. 

Having learned my basic scientific education at Technische Universität Berlin (aerospace engineering), I realized early on how important it is for me to view my engineering activities in a broader sociocultural context. My time at HPI School of Design Thinking further sharpened my personal perspective on the (mostly) wonderful world we are living in. And as long as I can read Roger Willemsen's books, I am grateful for each day on Earth.
